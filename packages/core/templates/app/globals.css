/* =============================================
   GLOBAL STYLES - Import from Active Theme

   This file imports styles from the active theme.
   DO NOT edit directly - all styles are in:
   contents/themes/{theme}/styles/globals.css

   This import is AUTO-SYNCED by the registry build process
   to match NEXT_PUBLIC_ACTIVE_THEME from your .env file.

   To customize colors, typography and tokens, edit
   the globals.css file in your active theme.
